This is a sample keymap file for the [Spacekeys](http://github.com/jlumpe/obsidian-spacekeys) Obsidian plugin. The keymap itself is defined in a YAML code block below, it is wrapped in a Markdown file to allow editing within Obsidian. To use this file, enter its path in the Spacekeys plugin settings.

You can use the "Spacekeys: Find command ID" command to search for command IDs (either by assigning it a hotkey or invoking it through the command palette). See the plugin's description for more detailed instructions.
